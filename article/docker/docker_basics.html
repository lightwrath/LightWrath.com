               <h1>Docker</h1>
               <h2>Installation - Fedora 31</h2>
               <p>
               I'll be installing this on Fedora 31, but the steps should be similar for other distros. Check our your Distro's wiki first.
               Enable the repository for docker in dnf then run the install command, when prompted press 'Y'.</p>
               <p class="code">
                  $ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
                  $ sudo dnf install docker-ce
               </p>
               <p>We can then start the service either from the command line as below or using the GUI fedora cockpit, within services.</p>
               <p class="code">$ sudo systemctl enable --now docker</p>
               <p>Note, should you get the error <em class="codeSnip">failed to start daemon: Devices cgroup isn't mounted</em> then doing the below should resolve this.</p>
               <p class="code">
               $ sudo dnf install -y grubby
               $ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
               $ sudo reboot
               </p>
               <p>So that we can start our containers using a YAML file, we'll install Docker Compose also.</p>
               <p class="code">$ sudo dnf install docker-compose</p>
               <p>Test the installation by running the hello world image.</p>
               <p class="code">$ sudo docker run hello-world</p>
               <p><em class="codeSnip">$ sudo docker ps</em> can be used to check the processes running in docker.</p>
               <h3>SELinux</h3>
               <p>
               If you have SELinux enforced then this can sometimes cause permission issues with Docker.
               To check if you have SELinux on your distrubution then you can run <em class="codeSnip">sestatus</em>.
               </p>
               <p>
               If you have SELinux installed and running then you should run <em class="codeSnip">getenforce</em>.
               This can either return Disabled, Permissive, or Enforced. 
               Disabled and permissive will mean you don't have to worry about SELinux, however on Permissive SELinux will still record and log violations for monitoring.
               While Enforced will block any file permission violations. 
               </p>
               <p>Docker supports SELinux for mounting volumes using either <em class="codeSnip">z</em> or <em class="codeSnip">Z</em>.</p>
               <p><em class="codeSnip">Z</em> should be used when the mounted volume is private to that container.
               <em class="codeSnip">z</em> should be used if the volume will be shared between multiple containers. 
               </p>
               <p>If accessing directories on your user then I would also add the user to the docker group.</p>
               <p class="code">$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER</p>

               <h2>Docker networking</h2>
               <h3>Docker bridge (default)</h3>
               <p>
                  By default images run in docker will be using the docker bridge. This is where containers are running on a virtual NAT within the docker engine.
                  This requires ports to be mapped to a container so inbound connects are forwarded to the correct container in the docker network.
                  So mapping host port 8080 to container port 80 will allow for inbound connection on port 8080 to be forwarded to the container on port 80.
                  By default container to container connections via the docker bridge are allowed.
               </p>
               <p>
               A custom bridge can be created, this acts the same as the default bridge but creates a sperate pool of container connections.
               Containers on this bridge can communicate with each other but not with containers on the default bridge or another custom bridge. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Containers can also use the host option to remove network isolation.
               This removes the need for port forwarding but comes with less control.
               Application ports cannot be changed via docker and so running more then 1 of the same service may result in port conflicts. 
               It also means less control over which parts of the containised application is available on the network.
               </p>
               <p>A none flag can also be set to disable networking for a container. </p>
