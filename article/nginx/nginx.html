               <h1>NGINX from source on docker</h1>
               <h2>Objectives</h2>
               <p>
                  To build Nginx in docker using a build file and compose file. This will be used to automatically deploy a website to Nginx.
                  I will later use the image to allow for scripted deployment of beta versions of the site for testing. 
                  This script should have a configuration file that will contain the port for the test deployment, this will increment with each deployment, this port should also be added to the container name for easy identification.
               </p>
               <h2>Creating a Dockerfile</h2>
               <p>
                  We can create a docker file to setup the environment for the Nginx server, download the source and install it.
                  The below is what I'm starting with to ensure we can get Nginx up and running
               </p>
               <p class="code">
                  FROM ubuntu:latest

                  RUN apt-get update \
                     && apt-get install -y wget build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev \
                     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

                  RUN cd /tmp && wget https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz \
                     && tar -zxvf nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz && cd nginx-1.16.1/ \
                     && ./configure \
                        --sbin-path=/usr/bin/nginx \
                        --conf-path=${NGINX_CONF} \
                        --error-log-path=${NGINX_LOG}/error.log \
                        --http-log-path=${NGINX_LOG}/access.log \
                        --with-pcre \
                        --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid \
                        --with-http_ssl_module \
                     && make \
                     && make install

                  EXPOSE 80/tcp 443/tcp 1935/tcp

                  CMD ["/usr/bin/nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
               </p>
               <p>
                  This will firstly get the latest image of Ubuntu, and then it will install the packages we need for building and also some packages needed for running the Nginx server.
                  It will then download the source files and extract them. Then run a configure with custom flags. After a make and make install will be run for installation.
                  Ports will be exposed that are needed and the command will be set for running Nginx. <em class="codeSnip">-g daemon off;</em> is used to ensure that Nginx runs in the forground of the container to keep the container alive.
               </p>
               <p>If the build fails during testing then ensure to remove the prevous image and container with something <em class="codeSnip">sudo docker container rm ID && sudo docker image rm ID</em> with ID's gained from <em class="codeSnip">sudo docker ps -a</em>, make the required changes and try again.</p>
               <p>After the image is created, it can be run with:</p>
               <p class="code">
                  $ sudo docker run --name nginx -e TERM=xterm -p 80:80 CONTAINER-ID
               </p>
               <p>Check your port 80 and we should now have the Nginx test page. </p>
               <h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
               <p>Now we have a basic deployment of Nginx's test server. We can set some environmental paramiters that can be chanaged on build using <em class="codeSnip">--build-arg</em>.</p>
               <p class="code">
                  ENV NGINX_CONF=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \
                  NGINX_LOG=/var/log/nginx \
                  NGINX_HTML=/usr/local/nginx/html
               </p>
               <p>We can build the image again using <em class="codeSnip">sudo docker build -t nginx nginxFiles/</em> adding <em class="codeSnip">--build-arg</em> if desired.</p>
               <h2>Running the image</h2>
               <p>Now we have our build image, we'll run it with the aruments we'll generally want when we make a docker compose file and test it with our content.</p>
               <p class="code">
                  sudo docker run -d --name nginx -e TERM=xterm -v /mnt/RAID/personal/Programs/lightwrath-com/nginx-logs:/var/log/nginx:z -v /mnt/RAID/personal/Programs/lightwrath-com/nginx-html:/usr/local/nginx/html:z -p 80:80 nginx
               </p>
               <p>
                  This should run our Nginx server and host the content in our local folder at lightwrath-com/nginx.html.
                  Make sure you have your content copied in this local
                  Note that the :z flag is only required for SELinux systems
               </p>
               <p>
                  Seems to work great, so I'll stop that: <em class="codeSnip">sudo docker stop CONTAINER-ID</em>. 
                  Now we can make a compose file using the same configuration and just adding a new names so we can easily identify our deployment.</p>
               <p class="code">
                  version: '3'
                  services:
                     lightwrath:
                        container_name: lightwrath-com
                        image: nginx
                        restart: unless-stopped
                        ports:
                        - "80:80/tcp"
                        environment:
                        - TERM=xterm
                        hostname: lightwrathcom
                        volumes:
                        - /mnt/RAID/personal/Programs/lightwrath-com/nginx-logs:/var/log/nginx:z
                        - /mnt/RAID/personal/Programs/lightwrath-com/nginx-html:/usr/local/nginx/html:z
               </p>
               <p>This can serve as the main deployment for the website.</p>
               <h2>Automating deployment of test versions</h2>
               <p>
                  Now I want to make a small bash script to copy files from the latest commit of the website, copy the files to another directory and run on a new port with a corresponding name. 
                  I'll make a small configuration file that I can use as a sources file in the bash  script. 
               </p>
               <p class="code">
                  name="beta-lw-v"
                  port=10100
                  sourceFiles="/mnt/RAID/personal/Code/lightwrath-site/*"
                  dockerFiles="/mnt/RAID/personal/Programs/lightwrath-com/beta-files"
               </p>
               <p>
                  Here is a my small script:
                  This will firstly create folders for the new deployment and then copy the sources files to the html folder.
                  A docker container will then be started with the name specified followed by the port.
                  The configuration file will then be updated with a port number increment to allow the next deployment to take place on another port with another name.
               </p>
               <p class="code">
                  #!/bin/bash
                  source lightwrath_deploy_beta.conf 
                  mkdir $dockerFiles/$name-$port
                  mkdir $dockerFiles/$name-$port/nginx-html
                  mkdir $dockerFiles/$name-$port/nginx-logs
                  cp -r $sourceFiles $dockerFiles/$name-$port/nginx-html
                  sudo docker run -d --name $name-$port -e TERM=xterm -v $dockerFiles/$name-$port/nginx-logs:/var/log/nginx:z -v $dockerFiles/$name-$port/nginx-html:/usr/local/nginx/html:z -p $port:80 nginx
                  echo "Deployment complete"
                  newPort=$((port+1))
                  sed -i -r "s/port=$port/port=$newPort/" lightwrath_deploy_beta.conf
               </p>
