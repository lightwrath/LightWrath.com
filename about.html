            <h1>About this project</h1>
            <p>
               This is a technology journey created and hosted by myself with the goal of using the best practices and latest tools to develop, build, test and deploy this site.
               I'll be using the site to write about the process. These articles are to serve as a reference to my findings and documenting the process rather than a 'how to' guide.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               At the moment this site is only using static content and will not focus extensively on development of dynamic content, this will be reserved for future projects.
               The main goal currently will be to setup and configure a fully automated commit, build, testing and deployment system.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               I plan to feature all relevant technologies for automating the process using tools such Docker, Jenkins and others for build and deployment.
               Then using Python and Bash to automate many server side processes.
               Along with using software for hosting such as Nginx and the equivalent tools within AWS.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Note: currently this site is in a testing alpha state.</p>
