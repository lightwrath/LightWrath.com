            <h1>About this project</h1>
            <p>
               This is a technology journey created and hosted by myself with the goal of using the best practices and latest tools to develop, build, test and deploy this site. 
               I'll be using the site to write about the process. These articles are to serve as a reference to my findings and documenting the process rather than a 'how to' guide. 
               At the moment this site is only using static content and will not focus extensivly on development of dynamic content, this will be reserved for future projects.
               The main goal currently will be to setup and configure a fully automated commit, build, testing and deployment system. 
            </p>
            <p>Note: currently this site is in a testing alpha state</p>
