                     I demonstrate my passion for technology in both my work and personal life. 
                     I’m an advocate for open source software and the Linux operating system. 
                     I enjoy investing my time into learning new technologies that interest me and finding technical solutions to issues in my daily life.

                     I run and maintain my own home Fedora server to host my own cloud services. 
                     This allows me to learn and develop my skills in the latest technologies and practices in my own time. Recently I have started to write about my personal advancement on this website.

                     I often perform my own projects and manage these though JIRA (self-hosted) using a Scrum framework, although this is intended for team development, 
                     I think it’s breaking down of large tasks, note recording and allowing for a flexible scope results in good planning and ensuring task completion is upheld.
